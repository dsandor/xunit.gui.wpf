# xunit.gui.wpf #
This will be the GUI runner for xunit when Brad Wilson drops it in v2 of xunit.  The goal for this project is to implement all the features of the old GUI in a WPF application.  We will also add the features requested by the community in the xunit issue tracker.

## How to build. ##
* Visual Studio 2012
* xunit source tree (version 1)

Place this project's xunit.gui.wpf file in the xunit's src folder.  This project makes project references to other projects in the xunit source tree.  This will change soon.
